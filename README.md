<h1> perform a brute force attack on a login page. Here's a breakdown of what the code does: </h1>

The code reads a list of passwords from a file named "password.txt" and stores them in a list called passod.
It then loops through each password in the passod list.
For each password, it strips any whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.
It creates a dictionary called data that contains the username and password fields for the login request.
It then sends a POST request to the login page with the data dictionary as the request body.
The code checks the status code of the response. If the status code is 200, it prints "its password : " followed by the password. If the status code is 403, it prints "error password : " followed by the password. If the status code is neither 200 nor 403, it prints "the wibaite you block ".
The code uses the requests library to send the POST request and the json library to parse the response.
It's worth noting that this code is not a good practice as it's trying to brute force a login page which is illegal and unethical.
